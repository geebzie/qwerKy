            <br>
            For many people, it may come as a surprise to learn that ‘hypoallergenic’ is a totally unregulated term. There is no country in the world which provides official certification for a ‘hypoallergenic’ item. This means that the term means whatever a particular company would like it to mean! Overall, this is a term which has considerable marketing-value, when in reality it should simply be ignored by consumers as it is a very misleading term! </p>

            <br>
            Comedo is the medical term for the primary signs of acne; blackheads are open comedones, and whiteheads are closed comedones. So this label implies that a product doesn’t contain ingredients that cause acne. But, there is no official definition for the term ‘non-comodogenic’. The Food and Drug Administration in the USA doesn’t regulate any over-the-counter products so this claim is not verified by any formal body! Adding to this, currently there is no universally accepted list of comedo-causing ingredients within the cosmetic industry. So this isn’t a standardised label. Therefore, approach the ‘non-comodogenic’ label with a degree of caution. </p>

           <p> & REALITY...
           <br>
           Parabens are a group of molecules (part of the larger chemical group known as esters) which kill bacteria and fungi. They are also very cheap, so are commonly used as preservatives. However, scientists are dubious about their safety. Two parabens in particular - propyl and butyl paraben - have been linked to breast cancer by a limited amount of research. But, the ‘paraben-free’ label is potentially very misleading as companies may be using even more dangerous preservatives instead. The FDA has confirmed that at the moment there isn’t enough evidence to be concerned about cosmetics containing parabens - so there is no need to look for products with this label!  </p>

        <p> & REALITY...
            <br>
            There are hundreds of different molecules which come under the chemical group known as the ‘alcohols’. However, this term only refers to ethanol. On the label of your cosmetics bottle ethanol may also be written as ‘SD alcohol’, ‘alcohol denat.’ or ‘isopropyl alcohol’. Scientists have identified this specific alcohol as being aggravating and drying on the skin. But, there are also many other types of alcohols - such as cetyl, stearyl, and cetearyl alcohols. These molecules are perfectly skin-friendly! So the ‘alcohol-free' label can actually be very useful for consumers as it signals the absence of the bad alcohols. </p>

            <br>
            Whilst any product can be ‘dermatologically tested’ - i.e. trialled on human skin - this label still gives a consumer little information. What were the company testing? Did the product pass these tests? Moreover, every company will have different standards for testing a product. Recent research shows that the public is confused - 13% believe the term means the product is kind to skin; 22% think it doesn’t cause allergies and 10% think it doesn’t cause allergies. So clearly, this is an intentionally misleading term. </p>

            <br>
             Mineral oils are a large and diverse class of chemicals, which have mostly been purified from petroleum. Mineral oils, which have a softening effect on the skin, are cheap substances which are available in mass. Resultantly, they are often used as emollients. However, dermatologists make it clear that mineral oils are in fact bad for your skin - the large size of the molecules means they cannot be absorbed. Therefore, they just sit on the surface and clog pores. So let your skin breathe and remember to stick to products which state they are free from mineral oils! </p>
